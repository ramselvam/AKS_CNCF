Completed

15 minutes
The Fruit Smoothies software development and operations teams decided to containerize all newly developed applications. Containerized applications provide teams with mutual benefits. For example,

Ease of managing hosting environments.
Guarantee of continuity in software delivery.
Efficient use of server hardware.
Portability of applications between environments.
The teams made the decision to store all containers in a central and secure location and the decision made is to use Azure Container Registry (ACR).

In this exercise, you will:

Create a container registry by using the Azure CLI
Build container images by using Azure Container Registry Tasks
Verify container images in Azure Container Registry
Configure an AKS cluster to authenticate to an Azure Container Registry
Create a container registry
Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Container Registry is private and hosted in Azure. You use it to build, store, and manage images for all types of container deployments.

Container images can be pushed and pulled with ACR by using the Docker CLI or the Azure CLI. You can use Azure portal integration to visually inspect the container images in the container registry. In distributed environments, the ACR geo-replication feature can be used to distribute container images to multiple Azure datacenters for localized distribution.

ACR Tasks can also build container images in Azure. Tasks use a standard Dockerfile to create and store a container image in ACR without the need for local Docker tooling. With ACR Tasks, you can build on-demand or fully automate container image builds by using DevOps processes and tooling.

Let's deploy an ACR for the Fruit Smoothies environment.

The ACR name must be unique within Azure and contain between 5 and 50 alphanumeric characters. For learning purposes, run this command from Azure Cloud Shell to create a Bash variable that holds a unique name.

Bash

Copy
ACR_NAME=acr$RANDOM
You run the az acr create command to create the registry in the same resource group and region as your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. For example, aksworkshop in East US.

Run the following command to create the ACR instance.

Azure CLI

Copy
az acr create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --location $REGION_NAME \
    --name $ACR_NAME \
    --sku Standard
You'll see a response similar to this JSON example when the command completes.

Build the container images by using ACR Tasks
The Fruit Smoothies rating app makes use of two container images: one for the front-end website, and one for the RESTful API web service. Your development teams use the local Docker tooling to build the container images for the website and API web service. A third container is used to deploy the document database provided by the database publisher and will not be stored in the database container in ACR.

You can use Azure Container Registry to build these containers using a standard Dockerfile to provide build instructions. With ACR, you can reuse any Dockerfile currently in your environment, which includes multi-staged builds.

Build the ratings-api image
The ratings API is a Node.js application that's built using Express - a Node.js web framework. The source code is on GitHub and already includes a Dockerfile, which builds images based on the Node.js Alpine container image.

Here, you'll clone the repository and then build the Docker image using the included Dockerfile. Use the built-in ACR functionality to build and push the container image into your registry by running the az acr build command.

Clone the repository to your Cloud Shell.

Bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api.git
Change into the newly-cloned directory.

Bash

Copy
cd mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api
Run az acr build. This command builds a container image by using the Dockerfile. Then, it pushes the resulting image to the container registry.

Azure CLI

Copy
az acr build \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --image ratings-api:v1 .
 Note

Don't forget the period . at the end of the preceding command. It represents the source directory that contains the Dockerfile. In this case, it's the current directory. Because you didn't specify the name of a file with the --file parameter, the command looks for a file called Dockerfile in the current directory.

After a few minutes, you'll see a response similar to this example.

Make a note of the pushed image registry and name, for example, acr4229.azurecr.io/ratings-api:v1. You'll need this information when you configure the Kubernetes deployment.

Build the ratings-web image
The ratings front end is a Node.js application that was built by using the Vue JavaScript framework and WebPack to bundle the code. The source code is on GitHub and already includes a Dockerfile, which builds images based on the Node.js Alpine image.

The steps you follow are the same as you previously followed. Clone the repository, and then build the docker image using the included Dockerfile running the az acr build command.

First, change back to the home directory.

Bash

Copy
cd ~
Clone the ratings-web repo.

Bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web.git
Change into the newly-cloned directory.

Bash

Copy
cd mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
Run az acr build. This command builds a container image by using the Dockerfile. Then, it pushes the resulting image to the container registry.

Azure CLI

Copy
az acr build \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --image ratings-web:v1 .
In a few minutes, you'll see a response similar to this example.

Make a note of the pushed image registry and name, for example, acr4229.azurecr.io/ratings-web:v1. Use this information when you configure the Kubernetes deployment.

Verify the images
Run the following command in Cloud Shell to verify that the images were created and stored in the registry.

Azure CLI

Copy
az acr repository list \
    --name $ACR_NAME \
    --output table
The output from this command looks similar to this example.

Output

Copy
Result
-----------
ratings-api
ratings-web
The images are now ready for use.

Configure the AKS cluster to authenticate to the container registry
We need to set up authentication between your container registry and Kubernetes cluster to allow communication between the services.

Let's integrate the container registry with the existing AKS cluster by supplying valid values for AKS_CLUSTER_NAME and ACR_NAME. You can automatically configure the required service principal authentication between the two resources by running the following az aks update command.

Azure CLI

Copy
az aks update \
    --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --attach-acr $ACR_NAME
Summary
In this exercise, you created a container registry for the Fruit Smoothies application. You then built and added container images for the ratings-api and ratings-web to the container registry. You then verified the container images, and configured your AKS cluster to authenticate to the container registry.

Next, you'll take the first step to deploy your ratings app. The first component you'll deploy is MongoDB as your document store database, and you'll see how to use the HELM package manager for Kubernetes.
