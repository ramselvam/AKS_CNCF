In the previous units, you exposed the Fruit Smoothies' ratings website and RESTful API in two different ways for allowing access to each instance. The API is exposed via a ratings-api service using a ClusterIP that creates an internal IP address for use within the cluster. Recall that choosing this value makes the service reachable only from within the cluster. The website is exposed via a ratings-web service using a LoadBalancer that creates a public IP address in Azure and assigns it to Azure Load Balancer. Recall that choosing this value makes the service reachable from outside the cluster.

Even though the load balancer exposes the ratings website via a publicly-accessible IP, there are limitations that you need to consider.

Let's assume the Fruit Smoothies' development team decides to extend the project by adding a video upload website. Fans of Fruit Smoothies can submit videos of how they're enjoying their smoothies at home, at the beach, or work. The current ratings website responds at FruitSmoothies.com. When you deploy the new video site, you want the new site to respond at fruitsmoothies.com/videos and the ratings site at fruitsmoothies.com/ratings.

If you continue to use the load balancer solution, you'll need to deploy a separate load balancer on the cluster and map its IP address to a new fully qualified domain name (FQDN), for example, videos.fruitsmoothies.com. To implement the required URL-based routing configuration, you'll need to install additional software outside of your cluster.

The extra effort is that a Kubernetes load balancer service is a Layer 4 load balancer. Layer 4 load balancers only deal with routing decisions between IP addresses, TCP, and UDP ports. Kubernetes provides you with an option to simplify the above configuration by using an ingress controller.

In this exercise, you will:

Deploy a Kubernetes ingress controller running NGINX
Reconfigure the ratings web service to use ClusterIP

Deploy a Kubernetes ingress controller running NGINX
A Kubernetes ingress controller is software that provides layer 7 load balancer features. These features include reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. You install the ingress controller and configure it to replace the load balancer. With the ingress controller, you can now do all load balancing, authentication, TLS/SSL, and URL-based routing configuration without the need for extra software outside of the cluster.

Screenshot of the ratings-web application.
There are several options for running Kubernetes ingress on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), such as Azure Application Gateway, Ambassador, HAProxy, Kong, NGINX, and Traefik. The ingress controllers are exposed to the internet by using a Kubernetes service of type LoadBalancer. The ingress controller watches and implements Kubernetes ingress resources, which create routes to application endpoints. Here, you'll deploy a basic Kubernetes ingress controller by using NGINX. Then you'll configure the ratings front-end service to use that ingress for traffic.

NGINX ingress controller is deployed as any other deployment in Kubernetes. You can either use a deployment manifest file and specify the NGINX ingress controller image or you can use an nginx-ingress Helm chart. The NGINX helm chart simplifies the deployment configuration required for the ingress controller. For example, you don't need to define a configuration mapping or configure a service account for the NGINX deployment. Here, you'll use a Helm chart to install the ingress controller on your cluster.

Start by creating a namespace for the ingress.

Bash

Copy
kubectl create namespace ingress
Configure the Helm client to use the stable repository by running the following helm repo add command.

Bash

Copy
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
Next, install the NGINX ingress controller. You'll install two replicas of the NGINX ingress controllers that are deployed with the --set controller.replicaCount parameter for added redundancy. Make sure to schedule the controller only on Linux nodes, as Windows Server nodes shouldn't run the ingress controller. You specify a node selector by using the --set nodeSelector parameter to tell the Kubernetes scheduler to run the NGINX ingress controller only on Linux-based nodes.

Bash

Copy
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
After the installation is finished, you'll see an output similar to this example.

Output

Copy
NAME: nginx-ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jan  6 15:18:42 2020
NAMESPACE: ingress
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
The nginx-ingress controller has been installed.
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace ingress get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-controller'
Next, let's check the public IP of the ingress service. It takes a few minutes for the service to acquire the public IP. Run the following command with a watch by adding the -w flag to see it update in real time. Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.

Bash

Copy
kubectl get services --namespace ingress -w
The service shows EXTERNAL-IP as <pending> for a while until it finally changes to an actual IP.

Output

Copy
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
nginx-ingress-controller   LoadBalancer   10.2.0.162    13.68.177.68     80:32010/TCP,443:30245/TCP   3m30s
Make a note of that EXTERNAL-IP, for example, 13.68.177.68.

Reconfigure the ratings web service to use ClusterIP
There's no need to use a public IP for the service because we're going to expose the deployment through ingress. Here, you'll change the service to use ClusterIP instead of LoadBalancer.

Edit the file called ratings-web-service.yaml by using the integrated editor.

Bash

Copy
code ratings-web-service.yaml
Replace the existing content in the file with the following text. Note the change of the service type to ClusterIP.

YAML

Copy
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ratings-web
spec:
  selector:
    app: ratings-web
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
To save the file, press Ctrl+S. To close the editor, press Ctrl+Q.

You can't update the value of type on a deployed service. You have to delete the service and re-create it with the changed configuration.

Run the following command to delete the service.

Bash

Copy
kubectl delete service \
    --namespace ratingsapp \
    ratings-web
Then, run the following command to re-create the service.

Bash

Copy
kubectl apply \
    --namespace ratingsapp \
    -f ratings-web-service.yaml
Create an Ingress resource for the ratings web service
For your Kubernetes Ingress controller to route requests to the ratings-web service, you will need an Ingress resource. The Ingress resource is where you specify the configuration of the Ingress controller.

Each Ingress resource will contain one or more Ingress rules, which specify an optional host, a list of paths to evaluate in the request, and a back end to route the request to. These rules are evaluated to determine the route that each request should take.

Let's set up an Ingress resource with a route to the ratings-web service.

Edit the file called ratings-web-ingress.yaml by using the integrated editor.

Bash

Copy
code ratings-web-ingress.yaml
Paste the following text in the file.

YAML

Copy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ratings-web-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: frontend.<ingress ip>.nip.io # IMPORTANT: update <ingress ip> with the dashed public IP of your ingress, for example frontend.13-68-177-68.nip.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: ratings-web
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
In this file, update the <ingress ip> value in the host key with the dashed public IP of your ingress that you retrieved earlier, for example, frontend.13.68.177.68.nip.io. This value allows you to access the ingress via a host name instead of an IP address. In the next unit, you'll configure SSL/TLS on that host name.

 Note

In this example, you use nip.io, which is a free service that provides wildcard DNS. You can use alternatives such as xip.io or sslip.io. Alternatively, you can use your domain name and set up the proper DNS records.

To save the file, press Ctrl+S. To close the editor, press Ctrl+Q.

Apply the configuration by running the kubectl apply command, and deploy the ingress route file in the ratingsapp namespace.

Bash

Copy
kubectl apply \
    --namespace ratingsapp \
    -f ratings-web-ingress.yaml
You'll see an output similar to this example.

Output

Copy
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ratings-web-ingress created
Test the application
Open the host name you configured on the ingress in a web browser to view and interact with the application. For example, at http://frontend.13.68.177.68.nip.io.

Summary
In this exercise, you deployed an NGINX Ingress controller and updated the ratings-web service to be accessible only from within the cluster. You then created an Ingress resource with a route to reverse proxy the deployment of the ratings-web service through a host name.
